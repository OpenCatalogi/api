        Based on the [top level component](https://yml.publiccode.tools/schema.core.html#top-level-keys-and-sections) of public code. represent a pease of software that may iether be  standalone or part of a larger application.

        **The PublicCode standard has been extenden for this API in te following way's**
        - To the `type` property the following enums where added
        - - Api
        - - Schema
        - - Data
        - The `inputType` property was used (its depracticed in PublicCode)
        - The `outputType` property was uses (its depracticed in PublicCode)
        - The `nl` country exenstion was added in line with the [PublicCode country extensions](https://yml.publiccode.tools/country.html) guidelines
        - applicationId was added for the codebase repository (like a github repository id).

The key value can be the relative path to the file starting from the root of the repository, or it can be an absolute URL pointing to the logo in raw version. In both cases, the file must reside inside the same repository where the publiccode.yml file is stored.'

            - development - Some effort has gone into the development of the software, but the code is not ready for the end user, even in a preliminary version (beta or alpha) to be tested by end users.
            - beta - The software is in the testing phase (alpha or beta). At this stage, the software might or might not have had a preliminary public release.
            - stable - The software has seen a first public release and is ready to be used in a production environment.
            - obsolete - The software is no longer maintained or kept up to date. All of the source code is archived and kept for historical reasons.

            It is suggested that the URL points to a hosted version of the documentation that is immediately readable through a common web browser in both desktop and mobile format. The documentation should be rendered in HTML and browsable like a website (with a navigation index, a search bar, etc.).

            If the documentation is instead available only as a document, put a direct view/download link as URL in this key. You should commit the document as part of the source code repository, and then link to it using the code hosting source browser URL (e.g.: GitHub URL to the file). Prefer using open formats like PDF or ODT for maximum interoperability.

            Whichever the format for the documentation, remember to make its source files available under an open license, possibly by committing them as part of the repository itself.

        apiDocumentation:
          type: string
          description: |-
            This key contains a reference to the API documentation of the software. The value must be a URL to a hosted version of the documentation.

            It is suggested that the URL points to a hosted version of the documentation that is immediately readable through a common web browser. The documentation should be rendered in HTML and browsable like a website (with a navigation index, a search bar, etc.), and if there is a reference or test deployment, possibly offer an interactive interface (e.g. Swagger).

            If the documentation is instead available only as a document, put a direct view/download link as URL in this key. You should commit the document as part of the source code repository, and then link to it using the code hosting source browser URL (e.g.: GitHub URL to the file). Prefer using open formats like PDF or ODT for maximum interoperability.

            Whichever the format for the documentation, remember to make its source files available under an open license, possibly by committing them as part of the repository itself.

        features:
          description: |-
            This key contains a list of software features, describing what capabilities the software allows to do. The audience for this text should be that of public decision makers who will be commissioning the software. The features should thus not target developers; instead of listing technical features referring to implementation details, prefer listing user-visible functionalities of the software.

            While the key is mandatory, there is no mandatory minimum or maximum number of features that should be listed in this key.

            The suggested number of features to list is between 5 and 20, depending on the software size and complexity. There is no need for exhaustiveness, as users can always read the documentation for additional information.

        screenshots:
          type: array
          description: |-
            This key contains one or multiple paths to files showing screenshots of the software. They are meant to give a quick idea on how the software looks like and how it works. The key value can be the relative path to the file starting from the root of the repository, or it can be an absolute URL pointing to the screenshot in raw version. In both cases, the file must reside inside the same repository where the publiccode.yml file is stored.

            Screenshots can be of any shape and size; the suggested formats are:

            - Desktop: 1280x800 @1x
            - Tablet: 1024x768 @2x
            - Mobile: 375x667 @2x

        videos:
          description: |-
            This key contains one or multiple URLs of videos showing how the software works. Like screenshots, videos should be used to give a quick overview on how the software looks like and how it works. Videos must be hosted on a video sharing website that supports the oEmbed standard; popular options are YouTube and Vimeo.

            Since videos are an integral part of the documentation, it is recommended to publish them with an open license.
